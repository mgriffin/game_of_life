# Conway's Game of Life
In C, on Windows.

I did my final year project in college using the Game of Life and in the years
since, I have made half hearted attempts to revisit it every now and then. This is
a more hearted attempt. It's also a way to learn some Windows graphics programming.

Feel free to look, read and fork. Help me make this better!
